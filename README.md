# Task-Manager
- A Multi-Project Task Manager created in flask, for an internship assignment.
- Code is well commented and all the css has been acquired from bootstrap.
- Easy to use and well to play around.
- A quick project and yeah its not well decorated .


## Installation
- I personally prefer using virtual env , You may use the global installaitiong to by adding `SUDO` before pip and `-H` after pip .
```py
    mkdir Project-Manager
    cd Project-Manager
    git clone https://github.com/kushthedude/Multiproject-Task-Manager.git
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
```
- TADA , Your app is ready to be deployed , open `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` on your favourite browser except IE (You know speed matters) to play with this little app.
